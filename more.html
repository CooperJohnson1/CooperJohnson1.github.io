        <p>
            A CPI calculator helps you understand how money changes in value over time. It uses
            the Consumer Price Index, which measures the average price of things like food, gas,
            and housing.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the CPI goes up, your dollar buys less than it used to — that's inflation. This calculator
            lets you compare how much money in one year is worth in another.
